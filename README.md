# FF3-Job-Leveler

A script that is made specifically for Final Fantasy III. The script does the mindless walking around in the overworld while also checking, using basic computer vision techniques, whether the player is in a battle or not and will press keystrokes accordingly to the situation.

- Open up FF3
- Go to where you want to farm (Altar Caves is best)
- Enter a place where it's safe to continously move up and down
- Enter a battle
- Do 'guard', 'guard', 'guard', 'attack'
- Enable auto battle
- Open script
- ???
- Profit

The script doesn't check if player is already level 99 (yet) or move the player to the right spot (yet). It's kinda dumb, but it'll get the job done.
